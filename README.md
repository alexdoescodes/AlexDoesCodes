**Hi, I’m @AlexDoesCodes**
- Student in the dual study program for Business informatics at Bayer
- Currently working in Leverkusen, Germany
- I mainly code in swift and java, but I am also fluent in python and have general knowledge in C++
- Besides work I'm interested in racing my bikes.
- Most of my work here is company restricted so you probably won't see much motion here.
